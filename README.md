"# RegisterUnity_SGD_v2" 
This repository is the verison 2 of Unity Registration automation in the website http://sgd2.lab245.com.br/.

I did this v2 to improve OPP skill with Python Language and all other libraries in the project.

Pros: More organized and maintainable.

Proposal: When needed to handle a large amount of Unities registration it tooks you tons of time with ctrl+c and ctrl+v. Thus, I made this automation OPP with Python, which takes data from a Excel file gived to us from the client, turn this datas into a Array then passes it to the right fields with a loop.
